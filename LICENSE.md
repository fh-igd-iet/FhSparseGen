## 1. INTRODUCTION

The FhSparseGen – Fraunhofer Sparse Matrix Layout Generator for Compound Entries ("FhSparseGen") is used to generate sparse matrix layouts and associated algorithms for varying parallel execution schedules.

FhSparseGen was developed at Fraunhofer IGD to enable joint optimization of sparse matrix layouts and schedules for parallel execution of the sparse matrix vector product (SpMV), primarily on massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs).
